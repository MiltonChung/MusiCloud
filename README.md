## About

This react project utilizes the basics of react like useEffect, useState, useRef while building out a music player app. It allows users to select any song from the library and play the song, skip forward/backward to another song, play/pause, autoplay, and more! I learned many things like how to structure a react codebase, how components work, how to pass props, and more.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

-  React
-  React Hooks (useEffect, useState, useRef)
-  Sass
-  HTML/CSS

## Features

-  Play/pause music
-  Click the music track to go to a certain time in the song
-  Skip forward/backward songs
-  Adjust volume using the volume slider
-  Dark mode
-  Music visualizer
-  Mobile friendly

## Challenges

-  The visualizer was hard to work with because it uses the HTML canvas property and making it responsive.
-  Customizing the input sliders to look more elegant was a challenge especially making it look the same in different browsers
-  First time implementing the audio tag in HTML and React respond to user input

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm and go into the root folder:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Inspiration

This app is built on top of Dev Ed's React tutorial.
