# MusiCloud

Simple Music Player website that allows the user to choose and play music from the library.

## About

This react project utilizes the basics of react like useEffect, useState, useRef while building out a music player app. It allows users to select any song from the library and play the song, skip forward/backward to another song, play/pause, autoplay, and more! I learned many things like how to structure a react codebase, how components work, how to pass props, and more.
